Just Another Bible Website or maybe something with new offerings and capabilities. 
Purpose: To share the Good News of Jesus Christ.  
There is an amazing amount of work being done on Bibles both in compiling a Greek text and in translations into English where they are put out on the Web in some sharable type of format 
and licensing.
**This site seeks to gather these resources into one user friendly site.** I hope you find these texts and tools helpful in learning of Jesus Christ and walking with him.
You can freely use these resources on the https://WhatsGodSay.org site and at the links to their various sources. 
If you want to use them elsewhere please ensure you are following their licensing rules.

Some goals of this site are:
Simple reading option without the chapters and verse numbers unnaturally breaking it up.
Powerful Word Study by showing the Greek behind the word, its definition, and where else the word is used.
Links to audio and videos when available. Audio to be available for verses entered.
Give you the ability to track your readings.
Give you the ability to add writings (e.g. note, comment, translation). 
Group or Public Forum - ideal to use for small group study discussions. 
Topics such as Love or Sin with a list of scriptures to see what God actually says on the matter.
